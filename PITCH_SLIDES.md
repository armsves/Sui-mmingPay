## THE PROBLEM

**Cross-Chain Payment Friction**
- Freelancers often want to receive payments on different blockchains than where clients hold their funds
- Manual cross-chain transfers are complex and risky for non-technical users

**Insecure Invoice Management**
- Traditional invoice systems rely on centralized storage vulnerable to breaches
- Lack of decentralized, encrypted solutions for sensitive financial documents
- No trustless way to verify invoice authenticity and secure transmission

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Swimming Pay: Secure Cross-Chain Freelancer Payments**

✅ **Decentralized Encrypted Invoice System**  
Freelancers submit invoices with encrypted file storage on Walrus + Seal (decentralized secrets management) for asymmetric encryption security and trustless document verification

✅ **Cross-Chain Payments via Wormhole**  
Seamless payments from Sui to multiple chains (Ethereum, Sepolia, etc.) with automatic token bridging and delivery

✅ **Sui Native Integration**  
Built on Sui blockchain with wallet-based authentication, smart contract automation, and high-speed transaction processing
